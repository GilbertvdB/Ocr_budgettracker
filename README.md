# OCR budgettracker
 This is a base repository public version of my Budget Tracker app found here:
 The webapp uses Tesseract OCR and other services to process an uploaded image and extract the total amount.
 Users just open the webapp, select the upload button and simply take a picture with their mobile phone. 
 The webapp processes the image and updates the remaining avaialble budget amount. Should the user report an incorrect amount the receipt will be up for reviews and corrections.

 Here are some key features:
 - The webapp lets users create budgets to track.
 - The webapp lets users set a budget amount to track.
 - The webapp lets users easily upload receipts via mobile camera.
 - THe webapp updates the budgets remaining amount available after uploading.
 - The webapp lets users verify the correct total amount processed.
 - The webapp lets users know when an incorrect processed total is in review.
 - The webapp lets users share budgtes.
 - The webapp lets users view a budgets expenses history.
 - The webapp has a mobile first design.
